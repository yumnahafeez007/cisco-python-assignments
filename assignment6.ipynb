    "#Assignment # 6\n",
    "##Question 1: Define Object Oriented Programming Language?\n",
    "###Everyone knows what an object is: a tangible \"something\" that we can sense, feel, and manipulate. The definition of an ###object in software development is not so very different. Objects are not typically tangible somethings that you can pick up, ###sense, or feel, but they are models of somethings that can do certain things and have certain things done to them. Formally, ###an object is a collection of data and associated behaviors.\n",
    "###The process of converting such requirements into an implementation specification. The designer must name the objects, define ###the behaviors, and formally specify what objects can activate specific behaviors on other objects. The design stage is all ###about how things should be done.\n",
    "###The process of converting this perfectly defined design into a working program that does exactly what the originally ###requested.\n",
    "#Question 2: List down the Benefits of OOP?\n",
    "###•Simplicity: software objects model real-world objects, so the complexity is reduced and the program structure is very ###clear;\n",
    "###•Modularity: each object forms a separate entity whose internal workings are decoupled from other parts of the system.\n",
    "###•Modifiability: it is easy to make minor changes in the data representation or the procedures in an OO program. Changes ###inside a class do not affect any other part of a program since the only public interface that the external world has to a ###class is through the use of methods;\n",
    "###•Extensibility: adding new features or responding to changing operating environments can be solved by introducing a few ###new objects and modifying some existing ones;\n",
    "###•Maintainability: objects can be maintained separately, making locating and fixing problems easier.\n",
    "###•Re-usability: objects can be reused in different programs\n",
    "\n",
    "##Question 3: Differentiate between function and method?\n",
    "###Function - A function in an independent piece of code which includes some logic and must be called independently and are ###defined outside of class.\n",
    "###Method - A method is an independent piece of code which is called in reference to some object and are be defined inside the ###class.\n",
    "\n",
    "##Question 4: Define the following terms: \n",
    "##1.Class 2. Object 3. Attribute 4. Behavior\n",
    "###Class:\n",
    "###A class is a template definition of the method s and variable s in a particular kind of object. In another words “A class is ###a user defined data type which have its own data members and member functions which can be accessed and can be used by ###creating an instance of a class.\n",
    "###Object:\n",
    "###Objects are the things you think about first in designing a program and they are also the units of code that are eventually ###derived from the process. In between, each object is made into a generic class of object and even more generic classes are ###defined so that objects can share models and reuse the class definitions in their code. Each object is an instance of a ###particular class or subclass with the class's own methods or procedures and data variables. An object is what actually runs ###in the computer.\n",
    "###Attributes:\n",
    "###Attributes are data stored inside a class or instance and represent the state or quality of the class or instance. In short, ###attributes store information about the instance. Also, attributes should not be confused with class functions also known as ###methods. One can think of attributes as noun or adjective, while methods are the verb of the class.\n",
    "###Behavior:\n",
    "###The behavior of an object is defined by its methods, which are the functions and subroutines defined within the object ###class. Without class methods, a class would simply be a structure.\n"
